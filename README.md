To get started , download the executable file into your mobile from this link:

https://github.com/hemantrkarora/Android_ODE_Solver/blob/master/odeSolverII.apk?raw=true
==================


The application will do the following :
a)	Solve Ordinary Differential Equations using Numerical Methods 
 
b)   Category of Problems : Initial Value Problems

c)   Take input functions in X and Y from the user and given the initial conditions with the precision(in number of digits) required will give the desired solution to the IVP using the below methods .

d)   Numerical Methods :
I.Single-step methods : 
		(i)Simple Euler,
		(ii)Modified Euler,	
		(iii)Improved Euler,
		(iv)Runge Kutta method of Order 4  
	      
    II.Multi-Step Methods : 
Milne-Simpson (Predictor-Corrector method)
